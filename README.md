# Feedback Fusion

This app enables users to submit feedback on services received.

## Features

- A Splash, Login, Register and Home Screen (Responsive).
- App retreives and saves user tokens.
- A Feedback page that enables users to indicate if the service received was successful or a fail.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Connect to a device or emulator.
4. Add keys in config file in directory "/asstes/cfg/app_settings.json".
5. Run the app using `flutter run`.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Extra Stuff

I have added screenshots of the app to the folder "/screenshots"
